define("_MI_formulize_SINGLESDESC","The 'All Done' button is used to leave a form without saving the information in the form.  If you have made changes to the information in a form and then you click 'All Done' without first clicking 'Save', you get a warning that your data has not been saved.  Because of the way the 'Save' button and 'All Done' button work in tandem, there is normally no way to save information and leave a form all at once.  This bothers/confuses some users.  Set this option to 'Yes' to remove the 'All Done' button and turn the behaviour of the 'Save' button to 'save-and-leave-the-form-all-at-once'.  This option does not affect situations where the user is adding multiple entries to a form (where the form reloads blank every time you click 'Save').");

This is a partial defence against cross site scripting attacks, meant to ensure only people actually visiting your website can submit forms.  In some circumstances, depending on firewalls or other factors, the token cannot be validated even when it should be.  If this is happening to you repeatedly, you can turn off the token system for Formulize here.  <b>NOTE: you can override this global setting on a screen by screen basis.</b>");

This option controls whether that checkbox is checked by default or not.  You should experiment with your installation to see if exports work best with or without this option turned on.");
